New Beginning Articles
===

It has been years since I set up my first github pages.  
Never used after that. Not quite like geeks.  
It's time for someone to set up goals and make a progress.  
Most journals{:.journal} will be records of my daily life and plans
which will be in  English.  
Technical posts will also be in English.  
Meantime, I will write some novel or essay in Chinese.  
Sometimes, Japanese may be used somewhere , somehow.  
Thanks for your time
