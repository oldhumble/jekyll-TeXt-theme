### Recommender System (5-8 to 5-10)    
## User-based Recommender System  
There are several categories of recommender system.The first is user-user collaborrative filtering recommender system. It is based on user-user similarity.  
User-user similarity has several methods to measure. Like Eulidean distance, cosine-similarity.  
## Unary Data Evaluation  
There are a lot evaluation metrics for recomender systems.   
Such as MAE,MSE,RMSE ,ROC_AUC, accuracy ,recall  
Every piece from that focus on one side of recommender system and make us improve recommender system from several ways.  
For a recommender system owner, we always have unary data.Like P(urchase)/L(ike)/B(rowse) etc. These data always have non-negative values.
## User-Centered Evaluation  
Recommender system are used for both user and commercial  purposes. So we should do a lot to focus on what users' experieces are with your RS.  
There are several ways to make that happen.  

- You may use A/B test for  randomly separated/ stratified sampled users
- You may use investigation/poll ,which you should know that saying and action are not always the same for human beings
- You may use Lab/No lab experiments to investigate
